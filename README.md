This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: forgetting to provide all required arguments when calling a function. The `bug.swift` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.swift` provides the corrected version. This simple example highlights the importance of carefully reviewing function signatures and ensuring all necessary arguments are included when calling functions to avoid runtime errors.
